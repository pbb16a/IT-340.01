                    Using our product is simple. To start, simply begin a new cycle. A cycle is any repetitive event or process (ie. recruiting a new employee or client, planning a regularly scheduled event such as a conference, or even taking care of menial but important tasks around the office). Simply tell our system what actions, forms, and questions make up the cycle, who to contact during the cycle, and when a cycle is over. Our system can handle the rest.
